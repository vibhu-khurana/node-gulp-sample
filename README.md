## How to create a task automation workflow using Gulp?
*This tutorial will demo how to set up a bare bones 
Gulp configuration for automating the time consuming tasks 
you need to run on a regular basis.*

It consists of three basic files which will be the 
basis for showing the power of Gulp, an index.html,
a style.css and a script.js. Have in mind these files
are only made for demonstational purposes.

point for the task automation itself. All the tasks we will
be running in this tutorial will be written in the gulpfile.js .
